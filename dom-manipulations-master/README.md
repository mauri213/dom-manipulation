# dom-manipulations

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Read, write, add and remove DOM nodes. 
* Manipulate the styling of DOM nodes.

## Instructions

Description and demo of each task are [here](http://magentanova.github.io/dom-manipulations/). You'll need to do the following: 

* Clone the repo at `https://github.com/TIY-Columbia-Front-End-Engineering/dom-manipulations` into a folder on your own hard drive.
* Change the remote url with `git remote set-url origin <url for your remote repo>` (so it points to a repo on your github account, not your instructor's.) 
* Edit `main.js` so that all the tasks outlined on the `index.html` page are performed as requested.
* Submit a link to a live site on gh-pages showcasing your work.
